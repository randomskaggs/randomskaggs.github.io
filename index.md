# Testing out GitHub Pages
I'm thinking about using this for my Rick Steves scrapbook entry. But I want to see how it looks.  Or maybe I should do it in a subdirectory. we'll see.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/randomskaggs/randomskaggs.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
